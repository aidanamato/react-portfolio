## Description

Welcome to my portfolio! I built my portfolio using the React framework, which allowed me to build a SPA that behaves as though it were a collection of separate pages. My portfolio includes an about me section, a section on various projects I've worked on, a contact form, and a link to my resume.

## Deployment
